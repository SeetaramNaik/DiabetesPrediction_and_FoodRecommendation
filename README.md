# Diabetes Prediction and Diet

This repository contains code for a web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on their health parameters and provides personalized diet recommendations. The application is built using machine learning techniques and the frontend is developed using Streamlit.

## Features

- Predicts the probability of having diabetes based on input parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, etc.
- Recommends a personalized diet plan for individuals based on their predicted diabetes status.
- Allows users to register and log in to the application.
- Stores user information securely in a database.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan0603/Diabetes-prediction-and-Diet.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py
   
4. Access the application by opening the provided URL in your browser.

   Once the application is running, you can access it by opening the URL provided by Streamlit in your browser. The application interface will be displayed, allowing you
   to interact with the features.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of this application:

- Python: The primary programming language used for backend development and machine learning.
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn): Utilized for building the diabetes prediction model.
- Streamlit: Used for developing the frontend and creating the web application interface.
- HTML/CSS: Used for styling and layout of the web application.
